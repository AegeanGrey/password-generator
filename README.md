# Password-Generator

## Description

- I wanted to take this code and enhance it by adding functionality to the webpage through JavaScript.
- This webpage is meant to help a user generate a passcode between 8-20 characters long that can include numbers, upper case, lowercase and/or special characters depending on the users prefence.
- I gained knowledge on how the following is utilized for building webpages:

Through JavaScript I've been able to provide functionality when a user clicks on a button. Helping guide the user by giving them choice through a series of pop-ups (How many characters the password is, which characters should be specified for the password, etc.) with Objects, Functions, If statements, Methods and Key-Values.

## Features

If you're in need of a new password with numbers and/or characters that are generated at random then you're in luck!

Here's how to use it:

1.) Open the Password Generator Webpage

2.) Click the red "Generate Password" Button

3.) A series of pop-ups will display asking the following:

- How long would you like your password? (8-20 characters)
- Would you like lower case characters?
- Would you like upper case characters?
- Would you like special characters?
- Would you like numbers?

The webpage will then load a new randomly generated password with the user selected inputs!
